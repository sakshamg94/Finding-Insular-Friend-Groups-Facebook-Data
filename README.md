# Finding-Insular-Friend-Groups-Facebook-Data
Experience the magic of graph spectra:  use the eigenvectors of a (tiny) subset of the Facebook graph to find large, insular groups of friends. 

A guide explaining the key workings of the spectral graph theory methods used in this work can be found on my website [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~sakshamg/portfolio/socialnetworks)
